# TCET Linux Wallpaper

This repository contains all the wallpapers that have been specifically made for [TCET Linux](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tcet-linux)

## Contributions

If you want to contribute to the repository that is make a wallpaper for TCET-Linux, you should keep these following points in mind:

1. Make sure the wallpaper's colour theme is similar to TCET-Linux, so it doesn't looks out of place in the distribution
2. It should be space themed
3. It should have our mascot/logo
4. It should have **TCET-Linux** written on it

Except of the first point, these points aren't 100% necessary, if you think your wallpaper will look good even without following all the points you are free to open a PR with the wallpaper you have made.

You can take inspiration from wallpapers we currently have to make new ones.
